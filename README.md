# Welcome to my react Blog Project App.
 Hi, 
 thanks for taking the time to read my wordy README.md

 my name is simon, i have a deploma in software development 
 this is my Blog app JaB( Just another Blog ).
 I will develop this app with the hopes of showing my progress and understanding of fullstack coding. Once deployed this will serve as my main outlet to show what  I am working on and what I have done so far... you can read all about my journey once this has been deployed.
 Once complete I will document dependencies and external tools used as well. This is mainly here to fill the empty space that would be here in all of my old apps.


 thanks and stay tuned
